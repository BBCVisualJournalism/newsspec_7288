    "question1_fact": "The outgoing Indian parliament contains many more men than women. While women have held all kinds of important positions ranging from president to prime minister and speaker of the lower house, only 11% of MPs are women.

    "question4_option_2_feedback": "Your independence could work in your favour.",
    "question4_fact": "In many sections of Indian society a married person is seen as 'normal' and 'socially responsible', and most Indian MPs are married. However, unmarried politicians often flaunt their singlehood as a virtue saying it means they can act without self-interest. Some of the country's powerful politicians are officially single, although some are thought to have partners and families: Indian National Congress scion Rahul Gandhi, the opposition party BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, leaders of powerful regional parties from Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh - three of them heads of provincial governments.",

    "question5_option_2_feedback": "Luckily for you, wisdom still trumps youth.",
    "question5_fact": "More than half of India's population is under the age of 25. However, when it comes to electing MPs, Indian voters have consistently backed greying leaders. In the outgoing parliament the average age of MPs was 53 years old. In fact, India's first parliament in 1952 remains the youngest on record, with an average age of just 46.5 years old.",

    "question6_option_2_feedback": "That's great. How about your rivals? Do you know any of their secrets?",
    "question6_fact": "Until recently politicians often managed to stay in power no matter how colourful their private lives were, but the rapid expansion of the Indian media means politicians' private lives are becoming ever more public.  India has more than 350 private news channels while social media is another factor making life very difficult for those who want to keep certain things undercover.",
    "question7": "Every candidate has a symbol by their name on the voting machine, to aid recognition and enable the illiterate people to vote. You want something striking, so which of these symbols will you choose?",
    "question7_option_1": "A swastika",
    "question7_option_2": "A gun",
    "question7_option_3": "A toffee sweet",
    "question7_option_1_feedback": "The swastika is an ancient auspicious symbol for Hindus and Buddhists, but sorry, it's not on the approved list.",
    "question7_option_2_feedback": "Maybe you were thinking that a gun indicates strength of purpose? Unfortunately, it's not on offer.",
    "question7_option_3_feedback": "Good choice. This is one of the free symbols ready to be allotted by the Election Commission of India. That should play well with voters who are known to have a sweet tooth.",
    "question7_fact": "The rules relating to the allotment of symbols are very strict. A party symbol can't be something that could offend any religious or social group's sentiments. Party candidates can use the party symbol. For candidates who are not affiliated to any party, there is a pool of symbols from which they can choose. The ruling Congress party has the palm of a hand as its symbol. The right-wing Hindu Nationalist party BJP has a lotus, which is one of the symbols of divinity in Hinduism. Aam Aadmi, a new party that has been founded solely on the anti-corruption ticket, has chosen a broom.",
